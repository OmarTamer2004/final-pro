# 🗑️ Garbage Classification Using Deep Learning

An AI-powered image classification system to detect and classify types of garbage (plastic, metal, organic, etc.) using deep learning. This project helps automate waste sorting, reduce environmental damage, and support sustainability efforts.

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Garbage pollution in natural environments—especially non-biodegradable waste like plastic—poses a serious threat to marine life, forests, air quality, and global health. Traditional waste sorting is manual, slow, and error-prone.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

We propose a computer vision system trained on real-world garbage images to classify waste types in real-time. The solution is deployed using a **Streamlit web app** and can be extended for IoT and smart waste management.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [Underwater Garbage Detection Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- **Classes**: Plastic, Metal, Glass, Organic, Others
- **Size**: ~10,000+ labeled images
- **Processing**:
  - Normalized to range [0, 1]
  - Resized to 224×224
  - Augmentation (rotation, zoom, flip)
  - Train/Validation split: 80/20

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) with:
  - 4 convolutional layers
  - MaxPooling + Dropout layers
  - Final Dense classifier with `softmax`
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, F1-score

---

## ⚙️ Training Strategy

- Data Augmentation
- Class balancing using `class_weight`
- Early stopping for optimal performance
- Training and validation curves plotted

---

## 📊 Evaluation

- Accuracy: ~XX% (add actual value)
- Visualizations:
  - Accuracy/Loss curves
  - Confusion matrix
  - Classification report

---

## 💻 Deployment

### 🔹 Web App (Streamlit)

A user-friendly Streamlit app where users can upload an image and receive:
- Predicted Garbage Type
- Confidence Score

### 🔹 Hosting

- The app can be hosted online via:
  - [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
  - HuggingFace Spaces
  - Render / Vercel (with slight modifications)

---

## 🔌 Hardware Collaboration (Optional)

- Edge devices like Raspberry Pi or NVIDIA Jetson can run the model in real-time.
- Smart bins with robotic sorting arms can integrate the model for automated waste management.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Improve dataset balance and quality
- Add support for mixed/uncertain waste
- Integrate with real-time video streams
- Add multilingual UI support
